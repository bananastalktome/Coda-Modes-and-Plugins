h1. Purpose
This repo is mostly just for me, to store the plugins and modes I use with "Coda":http://www.panic.com/coda/ . In order to more easily create this repo, I slipped in a few modes found in other repos, noted below.

h2. Modes include:

h3. ApacheConf.mode

A user contributed mode from the "SubethaEdit Modes Website":http://www.codingmonkeys.de/subethaedit/modes.html

h3. bash.mode

Can't remember where I found this, but drop me a line if you are the original creator and I will include mention here.

I created this mode to provide absolute basic syntax highlighting for .properties files (mostly just comments, boolean true|false, and numbers)
