=======
 
This is a Coda/SubEthaEdit syntax coloring mode for the CoffeeScript language.
 
Special thanks to brajeshwar's Sass.Mode and jashkenas' TextMate bundle--       
I used them for reference while developing this mode.
 
 
Installation
============
 
- Download and unpack either the ZIP or TAR version of the CoffeeScript mode.
- Rename the unzipped directory to 'CoffeeScript.mode'.
- Coda:
  Manually copy the CoffeeScript.mode directory into ~/Library/Application\ Support/Coda/Modes/.
- SubEthaEdit:
  Open the CoffeeScript.mode file from within SubEthaEdit using the File > Open command 
  or by dragging the CoffeeScript.mode file onto the SubEthaEdit application icon in the dock.
 
Extras
------------
Chendrix made an alternate [light-on-dark color scheme](https://github.com/chendrix/Specials-Board) for those who prefer the dark side.
